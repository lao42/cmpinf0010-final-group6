I'm not a talker. And I'm not a midnight joker either. And I'm not joking around when I say that Pittsburgh is the reason I have to carry this albuterol inhaler around. The fact that these males have gone back to polluting our air in the middle of a viral pandemic is beyond unthinkable. I can't begin to tell you how infuriating it is to know these companies are putting our lives at risk just to make a buck. 

We know that air pollution increases the chance of getting COVID-19 and what they're putting into our air, water, and land include many things that we also know to be carcinogenic. The people of this area deserve so much better then this and I personally went to express my disappointment in the ACHD. More can be done. 

These mills, whether they are inside Allegheny County or not, are having a huge impact on the quality of life here in Allegheny County. We should have some way of legally defending ourselves from this nonsense."
